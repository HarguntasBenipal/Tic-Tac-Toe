# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple Tic Tac Toe game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I collaborated with a friend to do this. Firstly, there is a animated "Tic Tac Toe" title at the top of the page. 
Then the program asks you to submit the first and second player's names. Then the program goes to a new page where the game is played. Currently working on using the names in the tic tac toe as well as diagonal wins.

Thanks,
